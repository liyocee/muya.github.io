This multi-part tutorial aims to show basic use of the Yii framework for basic tasks.
Yii is a powerful PHP framework for building web applications.

The project we will be undertaking during the course of this tutorial will
involve creating a system that will be used in a university to allow online booking of rooms.

This tutorial takes a ‘do-as-you-learn’ approach. You are encouraged to follow
through for better understanding. However, code for each part of the tutorial
will be made available. I'm also assuming that you have basic knowledge of
HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, MySQL and OOP. Basic understanding of the Yii
framework (such as creating a project, etc) is also an advantage.

Also, this project takes an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach, as does Yii.

Finally, much as this tutorial aims to show usage of Yii, it is far from exhaustive.
Mostly, learning more about the framework comes from the need to perform a specific task,
some of which may not be covered by this tutorial. You are encouraged to check out
[Yii Forums](http://www.yiiframework.com/forum), as well as other forums such as
[Stack Overflow](http://stackexchange.com/) in case of additional queries.
Also feel free to ask me any questions.

All the best!!!
