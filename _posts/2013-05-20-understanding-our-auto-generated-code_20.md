In part 3 of the Yii tutorial, we'll go through the auto-generated Controller code.

The `UsersController` class extends Yii’s Controller class. It handles all logic involving redirecting to specific views, e.g. list, view, admin, etc. All controllers generated by Gii extend the Controller class, and they have the same methods: `filters`, `accessRules`, `actionView`, `actionCreate`, `actionUpdate`, `actionDelete`, `actionIndex`, `actionAdmin`, `loadModel`, `performAjaxValidation`

We'll discuss some of the functions briefly, one by one.

The **`filters`** method determines which actions should be run before or after any controller action is executed, e.g. ensuring that a user has permission before performing a create action. You can read more about filters [here](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/1.1/en/basics.controller#filter){:target="blank"}

The **`accessRules`** method defines rules by which users are allowed to access specific controller actions.

All methods beginning with 'action' represent actions that are accessible from the URL. For example, contents displayed on loading the url: [http://localhost/StudentPortal/index.php/users/admin](http://localhost/StudentPortal/index.php/users/admin) is determined by the function `actionAdmin` of the `UsersController`, same goes for [http://localhost/StudentPortal/index.php/users/view/id/1](http://localhost/StudentPortal/index.php/users/view/id/1), which is determined by `actionView`

You'll notice that `actionView` accepts one parameter, `id`. This is the same string that is on the URL. More on this later.

The function `loadModel` is a utility function that returns the model having the given id.

The function `performAjaxValidation` does AJAX-based validation of a model. More on this later too.

And that's it! We now have a basic understanding of our `UsersController`. Please don’t hesitate to ask any questions in the comments below. Next up, we’ll look at the views...
